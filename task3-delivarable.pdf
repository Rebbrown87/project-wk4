üìò Project Overview: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
This project applies machine learning techniques to optimize resource allocation by predicting issue priority levels (high, medium, low) using medical diagnostic data. Leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Kaggle, we aim to demonstrate how predictive models can support decision-making in healthcare and other resource-sensitive domains.

üîç Workflow Summary
Data Preprocessing: We begin by cleaning the dataset, removing irrelevant columns, and mapping diagnostic labels to priority levels. This step ensures the data is structured and meaningful for modeling.

Feature Engineering & Labeling: Diagnosis labels ('M' for malignant, 'B' for benign) are mapped to priority categories. These are then encoded numerically to serve as target variables for classification.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the processed data. This ensemble method is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle feature interactions effectively.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance is assessed using accuracy and F1-score, providing insight into both overall correctness and balance across priority classes.

üéØ Outcome
The trained model can predict issue priority based on diagnostic features, offering a scalable approach to triaging cases or allocating resources. This framework can be adapted to other domains such as cybersecurity, agriculture, or education, where prioritization is key.

## Project Summary

This notebook demonstrates how predictive analytics can support resource allocation by classifying issue priority levels using diagnostic data. We preprocess the Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset, map diagnosis to priority categories, and train a Random Forest model. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Key Takeaways

- Random Forest provides robust classification for priority prediction.
- The workflow is modular and adaptable to other domains (e.g., agriculture, cybersecurity).
- Feature importance can be visualized to support interpretability and decision-making.
