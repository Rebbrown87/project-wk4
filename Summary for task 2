Summary: AI in Software Testing

AI enhances software testing by expanding test coverage, improving efficiency, and adapting to continuous change. 
Through automated and intelligent test case generation, AI analyzes application requirements, user behavior, and code updates to uncover gaps often missed in manual testing. 
It enables scalable and continuous testing, executing large numbers of test cases rapidly to detect defects early.
Moreover, AI ensures adaptive maintenance by automatically updating tests as software evolves, reducing manual effort and keeping test coverage high in agile and DevOps environments.
